# Typescript

Typescript extends JavaScript and improve the developer experience. It enables developer to add `type safty` to their project.

# Types

-----> There are different types are available
`Number`, `String`, `Boolean`
`Null`, `Undefined`, `Void`
`Object`, `Array`, `Tuples`
`Any`, `Never`, `Unknown` .....

# Situations

-----> There are many situations where we can use typescript

1.  A function accept only 2 argument of type `number`
2.  A function that always return `string`

# Syntax

let variableName : `type` = `value`

# Typescript Vs Javascript

-> Typescript support `Object-Oriented-Paradigm` where Javascript is `prototype` based language.
-> Typescript is a `Static-Typed` language but Javascript is `Dynamic-Typed` language.
-> Typescript support `Interface` but Javascript does not.

# Features that makes Typescript better than Javascript

-> Typescript always point out the `compilation errors` at the time of development. Because of this the count of runtime errors get reduce.
-> Typescript check type correctness at compile time. This feature is not in Javascript.
-> Typescript is `Version Independent` which means typescript compiler can compile `.ts` files into ES3,ES4,ES5 also.
